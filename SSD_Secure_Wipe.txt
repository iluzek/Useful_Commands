Step 1: NOT Frozen

In the first step, check if the SSD is in the not frozen state and support SSD Secure Erase (supported: enhanced erase):

root@ubuntu-10-04:~# hdparm -I /dev/sdb

/dev/sdb:

ATA device, with non-removable media
	Model Number:       INTEL SSDSA2M160G2GC                    
	Serial Number:      CVPO014602FC160AGN  
	Firmware Revision:  2CV102HD
	Transport:          Serial, ATA8-AST, SATA 1.0a, SATA II Extensions, SATA Rev 2.5, SATA Rev 2.6
[...]
Security: 
	Master password revision code = 65534
		supported
	not	enabled
	not	locked
	not	frozen
	not	expired: security count
		supported: enhanced erase
	2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.
[...]

Step 1.5 If Frozen, try putting PC into Sleep or Hybernation. This should set SSD to NOT FROZEN'

Step 2: Set the User Passwords

So that you can execute a secure erase, you must first define a user password. In the example, we have used the password, Eins. The security feature will be enable thereafter.

Warning: If you set the user password, the SSD will entire the locked state after re-booting. The SSD will then block all normal access until it is re-locked with the correct password. However, if you perform the additional steps completely (without re-booting), the security feature will be automatically deactivated.

hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass password /dev/sdb

root@ubuntu-10-04:~# hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Eins /dev/sdb
security_password="Eins"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password="Eins", user=user, mode=high
root@ubuntu-10-04:~# hdparm -I /dev/sdb
[...]
Security: 
	Master password revision code = 65534
		supported
		enabled
	not	locked
	not	frozen
	not	expired: security count
		supported: enhanced erase
	Security level high
	2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.
[...]

Step 3: Secure Erase

Now, execute the secure erase procedure:

root@ubuntu-10-04:~# time hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Eins /dev/sdb
security_password="Eins"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="Eins", user=user

real	0m55.408s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.000s
root@ubuntu-10-04:~# 

Step 4: Checking

After the secure erase procedure has completed, the SSD security feature will be disabled.

root@ubuntu-10-04:~# hdparm -I /dev/sdb
[...]
Security: 
	Master password revision code = 65534
		supported
	not	enabled
	not	locked
	not	frozen
	not	expired: security count
		supported: enhanced erase
	2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.
